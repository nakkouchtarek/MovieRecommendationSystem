# MovieRecommendationSystem

In this project, we focused on recommendations based on the user's ratings and the similarity between movies. Using item based filtering and cosine similarity, and also an extension that tracks the user's browsing to determine movies that might reside within pages he visits, we can recommend movies that the user might like.
<br/>
We also added in a full on interactive web app written in React to accompany our Python backend in order to give a similar experience to that of current streaming services.
